  faq:
    section1:
      title: "Juices"
      question1: "I’m still confused about “cold-pressed” versus traditional juicing processes. Can you explain more?"
      answer1-section1: "Traditional (centrifugal) juicing processes involve extensive friction (heat), which destroys the enzymes and nutrients within the fruits and vegetables. "
      answer1-section2: "Our juices are cold­-pressed. Using a Norwalk Juice Press (the premier juice press on the market), fresh fruits and vegetables are slowly broken down and then pressed so that they never endure heat. Cold­-pressed juices are better for your health and have a longer shelf life than those made using traditional juicers. "
      question2: "Pressed juices don’t contain fiber, but isn’t it important for my health and detoxing?"
      answer2-section1: "First, let’s distinguish between a juice and smoothie."
      answer2-section2: "Smoothies are blended fruits and vegetables – the fiber remains intact. Because smoothies are fiber containing, they aid in digestion and help lightly detoxify your body. Juices are the nectar of fruits and vegetables, separated from the pulp (fiber). Juices are highly detoxifying and don’t require digestion – their nutrition quickly enters into your bloodstream, offering you almost instant benefits. "
      answer2-section3: "The key difference between juices and smoothies is that juices give your body a break from the exhaustive digestion process. In doing so, your body can focus on repairing and healing – improving your complexion, reducing bloat, clearing mind fog, strengthening your hair and nails, supporting regularity, helping you to lose unwanted weight and so much more. "
      answer2-section4: "Fiber is important, but juices are not meant to be the source – you can get plenty of fiber from a healthy diet full of fresh greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds and legumes. Cold­-pressed juices are invaluable tools that are highly medicinal and cleansing. Without a doubt, we could all use cold-­pressed juices in our lives. "
      question3: "Does JÜS use organic ingredients?"
      answer3: "What we’ve learned living in Istanbul and exploring the organic scene is that the label “organic” on certain products often holds little weight or is simply false advertising. For us, a cold­-pressed juice is not “organic” if it contains 1 organic apple and 8 other conventional ingredients. We at JÜS strive to be as organic as possible, and we don’t take that responsibility lightly. Unfortunately, the reality in Istanbul is that both a lack of access, unjustifiable prices and seasonal restraints make it difficult to offer a completely organic product year­-round. However, we are happy to work closely with organic farmers so that we can supply you with juices that are mostly organic, 100% of the time. If you have questions about the organic ingredients used in your JÜS juice, please contact us to ask: "
      question4: "Does JÜS use sweeteners?"
      answer4-section1: "The JÜS team is well­ aware of buzz­worthy superfoods and miracle sweeteners on the market. However, we’ve done our research and are equipped with a resident certified nutritionist to tell us like it is. "
      answer4-section2: "We depend on the natural sweetness of raw fruits and starchy vegetables to complement our juices. Our choice is stevia. Stevia derives from the stevia leaf and has been used medicinally for centuries. It is 300­-times sweeter than regular sugar, so a little goes a long way. We use liquid stevia, a clear, non­bitter form of stevia that adds that extra sweet deliciousness. "
      answer4-section3: "From years of personal experience, extensive research and taste, we have determined stevia to be the downright best choice when it comes to your well­being. "
      answer4-section4: "The popular, so­called “healthy” sweeteners such as agave are often marketing ploys. Agave is a heavily-processed syrup (despite claims, it is never truly “raw”). It was once touted as a low­-glycemic sweetener, meaning it won’t cause spikes in your blood sugar levels like regular white sugar. However, what’s more important than the glycemic index is the level of fructose in it. Agave contains more fructose than any other common sweetener, including high­-fructose corn syrup. Fructose converts to fat more easily than glucose and poses a danger to your cardiovascular system. It’s safe to say that agave has and never will be on our menu. "
      answer4-section5: "Now, don’t let this “fructose” talk get you scared of fruit juices. Remember, fruits are the unprocessed, untainted products of Mother Nature. Our juices are thoughtfully balanced between with vegetable juices so you never have to worry. "
      answer4-section6: "Honey, in its raw state, is a superfood that has incredible medicinal force. However, it has a high­-glycemic index and will cause spikes in your blood­ sugar levels. Additionally, it is not animal­-friendly. "
      question5: "I’m not used to the taste of green juice. Now what?"
      answer5: "Fake it ‘til you make it! Seriously. Not that it has to taste bad, but green juice shouldn’t taste like a fruity cocktail – it should taste mostly like greens and veggies with a bit of lemon and apple to cut any bitterness. You may not be familiar with the taste of green juice at first, but trust us, it’s a slippery slope to green juice obsession. Soon enough, you won’t be able to live without it. We have traversed the globe in search of cold­-pressed green juices and use the knowledge we developed to properly pair taste with green leaf nutrition. Let us know what you think about our green (and other) juices: "
      question6: "Why doesn’t JÜS list calories?"
      answer6-section1: "The produce we use is fresh, raw and mostly organic, complementing a healthy lifestyle and infusing you with living enzymes and unmatched energy. The calorie system can never do justice to our juices, which are full of Mother Nature’s finest creations. "
      answer6-section2: "The calorie system is antiquated, restrictive and misleading. Using calories as a measurement of health or true, lasting weight loss would show a lack of understanding of the variety in our lives. Each calorie is different, with some easier for the body to process than others. Calories, large or small, are not trustworthy indicators of whether or not a food or drink is healthy and meaningful for our diet. Shed the belief that “zero calories”, “fat­-free” and “carb­-free” are desirable features of food and drinks. Do not let false marketing control your dietary needs. "
      answer6-section3: "However, if you are absolutely keen on knowing the caloric content of our juices, please contact us for more information: "
      question7: "How long do the juices stay fresh?"
      answer7: "The juices last 3 days from delivery and require refrigeration. "
    section2:
      title: "Cleansing"
      question1: "Why do I need to cleanse – isn’t that too extreme?"
      answer1-section1: "No, it is not. Cleansing is an ancient practice used by many cultures and religions for thousands of years. The terms \"cleanse\" and \"detox\" have been picking up steam in recent times, but don't let that lead you to believe that cleansing is simply a trend or something too extreme to ever commit to more than once. Yes, some people can take it to the extreme by cleansing for too long and without respect to their body's readiness to do so, but that is not what juice JÜS supports. If administered properly, a cleanse can be a great way to reset your body. On a day-to-day basis, cleansing can be a way of life - nothing extreme at all. Incorporating cold-pressed juices - especially green ones - into your morning routine is a great way to set yourself up for a day of high energy and light detoxification, leaving your cells happy from the start. "
      answer1-section2: "We offer a range of cleanses in order to complement every kind of lifestyle. We often eat more than we actually realize or need, and much of what we consume includes simple starches, white sugars and flours, processed foods, additives, stabilizers, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, overcooked oils, trans fats, wheat, gluten, animal protein and other animal byproducts. Sometimes it’s helpful to take a break from your regular diet, letting your body do what it does best: repair itself without distraction. "
      answer1-section3: "A juice cleanse is when you subsist entirely on raw fruit and vegetable juices for a certain amount of time. It is a great way to give your digestive system a break, so that you body can work on other bodily processes, like clearing up skin, healing organs and repairing tissue. "
      question2: "How long should I cleanse for?"
      answer2: "We suggest taking part in a 1­-day cleanse each month for consistent benefits. If you would like to cleanse less often, but still see results, we suggest a 3­-day long cleanse each turn of the season. For more intense cleansing, please consult our resident nutritional expert for a consultation: "
      question3: "How do I prepare for a cleanse?"
      answer3-section1:
        bullet1: "Before (1­-2 days)"
        bullet2: "∙ Eat plenty of raw fruits and vegetables"
        bullet3: "∙ Do not consume animal protein"
        bullet4: "∙ Chew your food well"
        bullet5: "∙ Avoid starches (bread, rice, potatoes)"
        bullet6: "∙ Drink lots of water"
        bullet7: "∙ Avoid caffeine and alcohol"
        bullet8: "∙ Don’t consume anything except water at least 3 hours before bed."
      answer3-section2: 
        bullet1: "During:"
        bullet2: "∙ The numbers circled on the lids of our bottles guide you through the cleanse follow them in order, from 1 to 6."
        bullet3: "∙ Consume the first juice of your cleanse when you start to feel hungry. Take note of your body’s “true” hunger signals."
        bullet4: "∙ Aside from the juices provided, you may only consume water and herbal tea."
        bullet5: "∙ It is okay to exercise moderately, but try to do so in the morning."
        bullet6: "∙ Occupy your day with your usual matters so that the cleanse is not the center of your focus. Enjoy the juices and stay positive. You are doing your body the greatest of favors!"
      answer3-section3: 
        bullet1: "After (1­2 days)"
        bullet2: "∙ Continue to enjoy cold­-pressed juices as part of your new lifestyle, drinking them on an empty stomach in the morning."
        bullet3: "∙ Eat lightly – focus on fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seed and legumes."
        bullet4: "∙ Avoid excessive oils, animal protein, rice, bread and potatoes."
        bullet5: "∙ If you’d like to eat dessert, opt for dark chocolate."
      answer3-section4: "Disclaimer: It is important to consult a doctor and do your own personal research about the risks involved with cleansing. We are not meant to replace professional medical advice and can only speak from our own experiences and those of others. Please consult a doctor with any questions or symptoms you may feel before, during, or after a cleanse. "
    section3:
      title: "Delivery"
      question1: "Why does JÜS use glass bottles?"
      answer1-section1: "The decision to use glass bottles is part of the broader mission at JÜS to provide you with the healthiest and most delicious product possible."
      answer1-section2: "To us, the decision is easy – only glass could bring our high­-caliber juices to you in the safest way possible, preserving the nutritional integrity of the juices while bolstering your lifestyle and dietary goals. Cold­-pressed juice is produced in a process that requires focus, detail and labor. A lot of intention goes into each drop, so if we are going as far to offer you juice of such quality, why stop there? "
      answer1-section3: "We took into consideration the realities of plastic waste management in Istanbul and both the known and unknown harms associated with plastic, which is made from petroleum byproducts, and went with what we felt would be best for both our customers and the environment’s well­being. We decided on glass. "
      answer1-section4: "We are proud of our 100% recyclable glass bottles. They are strong, bold and beautiful. Our customers often tell us that the glass bottles even make our cold­-pressed juice taste better! We have also set up a glass bottle return and rewards program. For every 12 bottles returned, clients are rewarded with a 500ml cold­-pressed juice of their choice. We take used bottles, clean and sanitize them and then fill them with more amazing juice. For us, this program offsets the resources used to create the glass bottles and helps instill a value of reusing. "
      question2: "What neighborhoods do you deliver to, and when?"
      answer2: "For delivery questions, please contact us: "
  
  about:
    title1: "Who We Are"
    description1: "No one in this city understands the biology and creation of cold-pressed juice quite like we do. With JÜS, we promise to offer only the best cold-pressed juices and plant-based food options available in Istanbul. While similar options do exist in this city, we have yet to find the taste, quality and concept that we can truly stand behind. Our goal is to create the highest standard for cold-pressed juices. "
    title2: "Aylin Erman"
    description2-1: "Hi, my name is Aylin and I am the founder of JÜS Istanbul."
    description2-2: "My personal experience with cold-pressed juice began nearly 10 years ago. At the time, I was studying at Harvard University and had reached a point where my dietary lifestyle no longer served me, both physically and emotionally. Conventional mass-marketed dietary suggestions simply didn’t help. It was then when I discovered the benefits of raw foods and was led to celebrity nutritionist and NY Times best-selling author Natalia Rose. Her books and friendship inspired me to lead a more conscious lifestyle full of raw foods and cold-pressed green juice. "
    description2-3: "I quickly witnessed incredible results in just about every aspect of my life – health, beauty and overall energy. I went on to receive advanced raw foods and detox training and interned for a detox foods home delivery and catering service, led by cold-pressed juice industry consultant Doris Choi, who is author of the Fresh Energy Cookbook."
    description2-4: "When I graduated Harvard, I expanded my knowledge base by working for NYC’s organic, raw and vegan cold-pressed juice chain Organic Avenue. I also became a certified clinical nutritionist. Meanwhile, I jumpstarted my own plant-based food blog, GlowKitchen.com and began to write and film about food and health for EcoSalon, Organic Authority and VegNews."
    description2-5: "After a year in NYC, I moved to Istanbul to connect with my father's side of the family, my childhood friends and the Turkish language, as well as explore new opportunities in health and wellness. Four years later, JÜS was born. "
