			We offer a range of cleanses in order to complement every kind of lifestyle. We often eat more than we actually realize or need, and much of what we consume includes simple starches, white sugars and flours, processed foods, additives, stabilizers, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, overcooked oils, trans fats, wheat, gluten, animal protein and other animal byproducts. Sometimes it’s helpful to take a break from your regular diet, letting your body do what it does best: repair itself without distraction.

			A juice cleanse is when you subsist entirely on raw fruit and vegetable juices for a certain amount of time. It is a great way to give your digestive system a break,  so that you body can work on other bodily processes, like clearing up skin, healing organs and repairing tissue.
