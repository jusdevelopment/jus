            <div class="LowerTitle">How long should I cleanse for?</div></br>
                We suggest taking part in a 1­day cleanse each month for consistent benefits. If you would like to cleanse less often, but still see results, we suggest a 3­day long cleanse each turn of the season. For more intense cleansing, please consult our resident nutritional expert for a consultation: aylin@jusistanbul.com

            <div class="LowerTitle">How do I prepare for a cleanse?</div></br>
                Before (1­2 days prior):</br>
                ∙ Eat plenty of raw fruits and vegetables</br>
                ∙ Do not consume animal protein</br>
                ∙ Chew your food well</br>
                ∙ Avoid starches (bread, rice, potatoes)</br>
                ∙ Drink lots of water</br>
                ∙ Avoid caffeine and alcohol</br>
                ∙ Don’t consume anything except water at least 3 hours before bed.</br></br>
                During:</br>
                ∙ The numbers circled on the lids of our bottles guide you through the cleanse ­ follow them in order, from 1 to 6.</br>
                ∙ Consume the first juice of your cleanse when you start to feel hungry. Take note of your body’s “true” hunger signals.</br>
                ∙ Aside from the juices provided, you may only consume water and herbal tea.</br>
                ∙ It is okay to exercise moderately, but try to do so in the morning.</br>
                ∙ Occupy your day with your usual matters so that the cleanse is not the center of your focus. Enjoy the juices and stay positive. You are doing your body the greatest of favors!</br></br>
                After (1­2 days)</br>
                ∙ Continue to enjoy cold­pressed juices as part of your new lifestyle, drinking them on an empty stomach in the morning.</br>
                ∙ Eat lightly – focus on fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seed and legumes.</br>
                ∙ Avoid excessive oils, animal protein, rice, bread and potatoes.</br>
                ∙ If you’d like to eat dessert, opt for dark chocolate.</br></br>
